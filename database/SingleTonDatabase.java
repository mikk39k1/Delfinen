/*
* This class is representing a database.
* Our structure is designed around a member list, and a coach list. and a swimmer/coach association list.
* This design ensures that whenever we want to work with members and results, we only need to work with the association list,
* since all members with coaches ar considered competitive swimmers. This design helps us achieve a faster design, and less
* search pairs to work with if or whenever this program had to scale member amounts.
